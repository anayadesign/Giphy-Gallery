# Giphy Gallery

**To do:**
* [ ] User sees search field and enters a search string.
  * [ ] Make it look nice. Better yet, make it pop. :tada:
* [ ] Based on search string, access [Giphy Search API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#search-endpoint), limit the results to the first 9 images, for now. No need to get too crazy. :wink:
* [ ] Parse JSON into markup, display images as as a grid.
  * [ ] Again, make [the grid](http://gph.is/11yryy3) look nice.
* [ ] User clicks image, launches lightbox gallery. :bulb:
* [ ] User has next, prev, and exit options to control the gallery.
  * [ ] When user gets to last image, next button disables
  * [ ] When user is at first image, prev button disables
  * [ ] Also, keyboard commands!

**!important**
* [ ] At any point, user can modify their search string.
